# babashka-passman

A simple Command Line password manager implemented using [Babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka), [sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) (via [this Babashka pod](https://github.com/babashka/pod-babashka-go-sqlite3)), [Honey SQL](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql), and [stash](https://github.com/rorokimdim/stash) (also via Babashka pod). 

Started by following Daniel Amber's YouTube tutorial, [Create a password manager with Clojure using Babashka, sqlite, honeysql and stash](https://youtu.be/jm0RXmyjRJ8). 

I may update it myself with some additional features/safety (maybe tinkering with adding [cli4clj](https://github.com/ruedigergad/cli4clj)).
